The Tasty App is a React-based application that allows users to search and browse meal recipes. It is a project that showcases the skills and knowledge our team acquired during a front-end bootcamp. The application is built using modern web development technologies and aims to provide a useful and practical user experience.

=== Pages ===

The Tasty App consists of the following pages:

- SplashScreen: The initial screen that appears when the app is first loaded.
- Onboarding: A page that provides an onboarding experience for new users.
- Home: The main page of the app, which displays a list of items.
- SearchArea: A page that displays a list of items filtered by geographical area.
- SearchCategory: A page that displays a list of items filtered by category.
- SearchResult: A page that displays a list of items filtered by search query.
- DetailsPage: A page that displays details about a specific item.
- ErrorPage: A page that is displayed when the user navigates to an invalid URL.


=== Components ===

The Tasty App includes several reusable components, including:

- SearchByName: A component that allows the user to search for meal recipes by name.
- MealOfTheDay: A component that displays a featured meal for the day.
- AreaSlider: A component that allows the user to browse recipes by geographical area.
- CatSlider: A component that allows the user to browse recipes by category.
- Navigation: A component that provides links to other pages in the application.
- LoadingSpinner: A component that displays a loading spinner while data is being loaded.


=== Styling ===

The Tasty App uses SCSS for styling. The styles are defined in separate SCSS files and imported into each component as needed.


=== Routing ===

The Tasty App uses React Router to handle navigation between pages. Each page is associated with a specific route, and the Routes component is used to define the app's routing.
